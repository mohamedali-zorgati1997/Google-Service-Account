# Google-Service-Account
This project is intended to simplify the authentification process required to use Google APIs with a Service Account.
You might be asking isn't there an official library for this. Well, yes but I like to see how things work and try to create my own version. This is like reinventing the wheel which looks pointless but in the process you learn a lot. With that said, don't use this in production environment, this is mainly for tinkering purposes.
# Requirement
This project uses the `requests` library so you might have to install it
an other option is to make your own get, post, ... functions and import them instead which is feasable with python native libraries but will need some hard work.
# usage
an example of usage is shown in `main.py` file. I tried to simplify things as much as I can.

# feedback
I really love to hear feedback, if you have anything like a feature (small project, I know, but keep in mind it can grow), bug, optimization or anything please contact me using github or anything else.
